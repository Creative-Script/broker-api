## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the project [change log](https://github.com/Creative-Script/broker-api/blob/develop/docs/CHANGELOG.md#changelog).

#### Commit Message Format

A commit message consists of a **header**, **body** and **footer**.  The header has a special format that includes a **type**, **scope** and **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body, it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix`  or `perf` it will appear in the changelog. However, if there is any [Breaking Change](#footer), the commit will always appear in the changelog.

Other prefixes are up to your discretion. Suggested prefixes are `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, and `test` for non-changelog related tasks.


* **feat**: A new feature.
* **fix**: A bug fix.
* **chore**: chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries.
* **docs**: Documentation only changes.
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: TravisCI).

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For example `authentication`, `forms`, `users`, `upgrade` etc...

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the [subject](#subject), use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
